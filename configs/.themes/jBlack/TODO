1. Evolution's "New" button background on the toolbar
   I heard this is a bug in Evo to tell you the truth I'm getting sick of all these custom things in evo
   
2. Hilight Firefox's main menu if it's selected
   I think it should be added to the userChrome.css

3. Change checkboxe's foreground (text[NORMAL] = white;)
   In gtkList (see for e.g. gedit->Edit->Preferences->Plugins) the checkboxes are totally black.
   
4. Progressbar is acting strangely 
   In firefox and some gnome apps the bar resizes sometimes and I have no idea why!
