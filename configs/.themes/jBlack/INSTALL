INSTALL Instructions:
=====================

   ./configure --prefix=/usr
   make
   sudo make install

   (you will have to create the jBlack directory)

5. jBlack emerald theme

NOTES:
======

Semi transparent menus
----------------------
Open up your beryl-settings go to Window Management->Set Window Attribs by various criteria click on Window Opacity and add the followings:
w:DropdownMenu:90
w:Menu:90
w:PopupMenu:90
w:Unknown:90 (neede for firefox to have transparent menus)
c:Conky:90

Transparent windows
-------------------
Open up your beryl-settings go to Visual Effects->Trailfocus and turn this on and set your window numbers as you wish but I set it to 1 so only one window is foccused but who knows which is better :)

Theme looks best with Avant-Window-Manager (default theme) which can be downloaded from here:
http://wiki.awn-project.org

and for system info maybe the best and simpliest is Conky (putting it on the top with one line), can be found here:
http://conky.sourceforge.net/

Enjoy,
Julius

ps: don't forget, if you see any bug or have any ideas please don't hesitate to fix/implement it and or drop me a letter
